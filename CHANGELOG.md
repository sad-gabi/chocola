# Chocola Changelog

## 2.0.0-next.8 (Jul 31, 2026)
18.5 MB
- **`node_modules` size dropped from 18.50 MB to 3.50 MB!:** replaced `jsdom` dependency with `linkedom`, wich has a smaller dependency tree, and is theoretically faster [[#74](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/75)]
- `del:if` was changed to `mount:if` to make it more semantically intuitive [[#68](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/68)]
- A critical bug made impossible to declare props with a `false` value. Fixed [[#73](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/73)]
- Changed the logging art for something more sober but still in-brand [[#72](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/72)]

## 2.0.0-next.7 (Jul 26, 2026)

Introduces client-side rendering capabilities to the Chocola framework. Components can now be compiled into JavaScript classes that extend ChocolaComponent, enabling dynamic component rendering in the browser [[#47](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/47)]

## 2.0.0-next.6 (Jul 26, 2026)

- Removed `chsrc` attribute [[#57](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/57)]
- CSS scope hashes are now deterministic, derived from the component's filename (e.g. `button.html`), so the same component always gets the same CSS scope class across independent builds [[#58](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/58)]
  - The hash class is always present on every component's root element, even without styles, serving as a stable component identifier for debugging
  - A reference map is written to `.chocola/hashes.json` after each build so devs can look up which hash belongs to which component
  - For its deterministic nature, `.chocola/` can be ignored in version control.

## 2.0.0-next.5 (Jul 26, 2026)

- Top-level functions can now be declared outside `$runtime` [[#51](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/51)]
  - They are scoped to the component and won't leak to other components
  - They are compiled into the component's context and can be interpolated in templates (e.g., `{format(value)}`)

- Added `bind:*` attribute for DOM element manipulation [[#50](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/50)]
  - `bind:self="var"` assigns the element to a script variable
  - `bind:<property>="var"` captures an element property (e.g., `bind:type="t"`)

- Removed `chalk` dependency — replaced with a minimal ANSI wrapper [[#49](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/48)]
- Removed `js-beautify` dependency — CSS/HTML output is now raw [[#53](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/53)]
- Codebase optimizations [[1edff39](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/commit/1edff39d6bb7565da78f844d2096d60d7e527da7)]

## 2.0.0-next.4 (Jul 25, 2026)

- Added Chocola SFCs [[#46](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/46)]
  - Now Chocola components are `.html` files with `<script>`, `<template>` (required), and `<styles>` tags
  - Props and their default values are now declared at the top level of `<script>` as `export let prop = defaultValue`; default values are still optional
  - `RUNTIME(self, ctx)` function replaced with `$runtime()`
  - Implemented `let self = new HTMLElement` as a DX placeholder.

- Updated `documentation/` and `README.md`
- Removed comments and JSDocs the user can't see
- Changed the main function of `compiler/index.js` from `runtime` to `compile`

## 2.0.0-next.3 (Jul 24, 2026)

- Removed `del-if` support [[#32](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/32)]
- Removed dynamic asset bundling support (`src`, `href`, `url()`) [[#39](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/39)]

## 2.0.0-next.2 (Jul 23, 2026)

- Perfomance optimizations, including:
  - Double-processing of DOM elements [[#35](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/35)]
  - Repeated new `Function(...)` compilation [[#36](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/36)]
  - `extractContextFromElement` recreates `Function` per attribute [[#37](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/37)]
  - `validateChainStructure` line-number search is O(n²) [[#40](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/40)]
  - `genRandomId` re-declares `letters` const on every call [[#41](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/41)]
  - `incrementAlfabet` uses `indexOf` per character [[#43](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/43)]
  - `interpolateNode` recursive without depth guard [[#44](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/44)]
  - Dev server uses two separate `fs.watch` calls [[#42](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/42)]
  - `app.build` ignores the returned promise [[#45](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/45)]

## 2.0.0-next.1 (Jul 23, 2026)

- Moved main Chocola imports [[#33](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/33)]:
  - `{app}` to `chocola/compiler`
  - `{dev}` to `chocola/dev`
- Added JSDocs for `{dev}`.

---

## 1.6.0 (Jul 23, 2026)

### Added features
- Added `del:if` as a replacement for `del-if` and deprecated the last one [[#27]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/27).
- CSS animations scoping [[#30]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/30).

### Fixed bugs
- A bug that would turn `{foo}` at `index.html` into strings [[#25]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/25).
- A bug that would make the compiler skip evaluating all Chocola syntax that were not direct children of the `<app>` container [[#29]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/29).
- A bug that would treat CSS non-selector at-rules as common rules and breake them [[#26]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/26)

### Optimization
- Remove code for processing `.choco` files since they were never implemented and aren´t planned to be either [[#28]](https://github.com/chocolajs/chocola/issues/28).

## 1.5.2 (Jul 20, 2026)

- Updated npm package description, homepage, and funding.
- Updated README.md

## 1.5.1 (Jul 19, 2026)

- Fixed a critical bug that would make the `npm install` process to crash while installing v1.5.0.
- Improved component loading, errors, and assets

## 1.5.0 (Jul 19, 2026) [DEPRECATED]

**DEPRECATION WARNING:** This version has a serious error that will cause the `npm install` process to crash. Please install a different version instead.

### Added
- Assets now can be imported from a `src/static/` directory instead of based on `src` and `href` HTML attributes or `url()` CSS functions setting `bundle.assetImport: "static"` config.
- Imports from HTML `href` and `src` attributes in `body`, and from CSS `url()` functions are still the default imports system, but now are deprecated and expected to be removed in Chocola 2. The `bundle.assetImport` value for static imports is `"legacy"`.
- Added support for using curly braces HTML entities.
- Added `elif` and `else` logical blocks; they must be siblings of an `if` block and arrenged in order.
- Added `<void>` HTML tags as wrappers that will be replaced for its children when rendered, being able to apply logic blocks like `if` to their children.
- Now scoped CSS selector also applies to the component's root element.

### Fixed
- Fixed an import resolution crash when a component's HTML template content was shorter than its import statement, which caused subsequent imports to be silently dropped during the build.
